## Introduction

`makecli` is a CLI to make CLIs(with Node.js and CoffeeScript). You can install it globally with

```
npm install @ch1c0t/makecli -g
```

Then, if you run `makecli new NAME`, it will create a directory named NAME
and replicate itself in this directory under the name NAME.
You can use this replication as a base for your application.
